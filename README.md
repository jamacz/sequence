# Sequence

Sequence is a card game about, using your cards, making rows of 5 on a board. Here is an (attempt at an) implementation of Sequence.

This game used socket.io and does not feature any encryption - each player can see each other's hands if they look in the console - so this shouldn't be used for anything more than the odd family meetup (I ran out of time to make this "good").
